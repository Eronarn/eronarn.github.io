Hi! If you are reading this, you are probably taking my Ansible workshop at SREcon 2018. Here's what you need to know:

- [Register for the SREcon Slack](https://www.usenix.org/srecon/slack) and then join `#ansible-for-sre`. We'll use that for troubleshooting.

- [Here are the slides for this course.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gsAKw_BxP8MNF4HE2ZI5PKqM6m9NfHnH9omyLfcyUHg/edit)

- [Here is the GitHub repo for the original course.](https://github.com/Eronarn/deploying-applications-with-ansible)

- Your instance is accessed via SSH at: `userXXX@userXXX.deployingapplicationswithansible.com`
