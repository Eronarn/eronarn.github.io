I presented at the Boston DevOps Meetup about how to make your meetings more effective. [A recording from the meetup is on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXSejfrLUfw&t=3873s), and [the slides are available on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zxrx-X1W766IjodC7t9IPIS1d3-GvQ3E5lJmkPvdZZM).
