title: Cooperative Economics for Engineers (DevOpsDays Boston 2019, DevOpsDays Hartford 2019)
---

This fall, I had the opportunity to present about the labor movement to both [DevOpsDays Boston 2019](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/welcome/) and [DevOpsDays Hartford 2019](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-hartford/welcome/). My talk is titled _Cooperative Economics for Engineers: or, Why You Have More In Common With Pirate Fleets Than With Your Manager_, and focuses on historical context to the question of whether tech should unionize. [You can find the slides from my presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b2M-0Rzs-K7ynvE-gfJLDxJItViytvX-7aBFkrtIGdY/edit), or [watch the recorded version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijdRF_b3WpY).
