title: Beyond Burnout (SREcon18 Americas)
---

I [spoke at SREcon18 Americas on the topic of mental health in engineering](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18americas/presentation/meickle-0), with a focus on how structural changes can create opportunities for people with mental disorders. [You can find the slides from my presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MYjrnIhb8SJhkJegAKLAgqozYw_7rD7tDvWi7bws_88/edit?usp=sharing), or [watch the recorded version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpofgSi_sZ8).
