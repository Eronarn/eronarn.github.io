[All of my previous presentations are available on this website](/). If you're interested in a more personal touch, I'd be happy to meet with your team, or to bring one of my workshops to your conference. I am currently available for short-to-medium term consulting engagements with an emphasis on education, training, and strategic planning. Topics that I speak on include site reliability engineering principles, devops transformations, data engineering (particularly with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)), and mental health in the workplace.

Haven't worked with a training consultant before? To set expectations, I charge a base hourly rate for any presentations, workshops, or trainings. If you'd like me to repeat an existing presentation or worskhop, there is no additional course materials fee. Creating custom course materials requires additional lead time as well as a separate fee, both of which are proportional to the complexity of the content (i.e., a six hour hands-on workshop might be fifty times as much work as a 20 minute lightning talk). I will discount the course materials fee by 50% if you agree to open-sourcing the training materials and video recordings afterwards. My invoice will also include reimbursement for the cost of training resources (such as EC2 instances), as well as any travel and lodging costs for engagements outside the Boston metro area.

If you'd like to book an engagement, please reach out to [eronarn@gmail.com](mailto:eronarn@gmail.com).
